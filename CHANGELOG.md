# Changelog

## Upcoming Release
### Features Added
- Azure Key Vault connections are now cached per credential/vault set instead of rebuilt on every key load, reducing bulk-load time. [#1222][PR_1222]

### Bugs Fixed
- Azure Key Vault SECP256K1 signing now uses one official Azure SDK `CryptographyClient` per key instead of REST workaround. [#1222][PR_1222]
- Netty is upgraded to `4.2.17.Final` to prevent io_uring read stalls on reused connections.[#1222][PR_1222]

### CI/Build Enhancements
- Azure Key Vault acceptance tests now run against local Azure emulator instance instead of live Azure.

## 26.7.0
### Features Added
- Support for Hashicorp Vault Kubernetes authentication [PR 1195](https://github.com/Consensys-Incorporated/web3signer/pull/1195)
- The eth1 signing endpoint (`POST /api/v1/eth1/sign/{identifier}`) accepts an optional `applyHash` field. It defaults to `true`, preserving the existing behaviour of applying Keccak-256 to `data` before signing. Setting it to `false` signs the caller-supplied `data` as a pre-computed digest, which must be exactly 32 bytes. Supported by file-based, AWS KMS and Azure Key Vault signers. [PR 1213](https://github.com/Consensys-Incorporated/web3signer/pull/1213)

### Bugs Fixed
- Fix Key Manager API (`POST /eth/v1/keystores`) accepting a keystore whose JSON `pubkey` field does not match the decrypted private key. A mismatched import now returns `status: "error"` for that entry rather than poisoning the slashing-protection database under the claimed (unverified) pubkey.

### Breaking Changes
- The Key Manager API (`DELETE /eth/v1/keystores`) now only attempts to delete keystore files that follow the `<pubkey>.yaml` naming convention. Files using a different naming scheme are left untouched. This replaces the previous approach of scanning all metadata files and matching on the EIP-2335 `pubkey` field, which is optional and not guaranteed to be correct.
- Java 25 is now required to build Web3Signer (previously Java 21).
- The `.tar.gz` and `.zip` binary distributions now require Java 25 on the host machine to run Web3Signer (previously Java 21).
- Docker images are unchanged — they have shipped Java 25 since 25.12.0.
- Contributors no longer need to install JDK 25 manually. The build now uses a Gradle toolchain (`JavaLanguageVersion.of(25)`) with the foojay resolver, so Gradle will auto-detect a locally installed JDK 25 and download Temurin 25 if none is found. The Gradle daemon itself can run on any JDK supported by Gradle 9 (17+).

### Security
- Update base docker image to latest LTS Ubuntu 26.04.

---
## 26.4.2
### Features Added
- Published Docker images are now signed (keyless cosign via Sigstore) and ship with SLSA provenance + SPDX SBOM attestations. See `docker/README.md` for verification commands.

### Infrastructure / CI
- Multi-arch Docker images (`linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`) are now built on native GitHub-hosted runners instead of QEMU emulation, with a smoke test running per arch before push.

### Bugs Fixed
- Fix distroless image failing to load BLS native library under `docker run --read-only`. Issue [#1175][issue_1175], PR [#1176][PR_1176].

[issue_1175]: https://github.com/Consensys-Incorporated/web3signer/issues/1175
[PR_1176]: https://github.com/Consensys-Incorporated/web3signer/pull/1176

---
## 26.4.1
### Features Added
- Publish an additional hardened Docker image under the `-distroless` tag suffix (e.g. `consensys/web3signer:26.4.1-distroless`). Built from `gcr.io/distroless/java25-debian13:nonroot` — no shell, runs as non-root by default, and is compatible with `docker run --read-only`. See issue [#1151][issue_1151].
- Docker image labels migrated from the deprecated `org.label-schema.*` schema to the OCI Image Spec `org.opencontainers.image.*` annotations, which are consumed by modern registries and image-scanning tooling.

### Bugs Fixed
- Fix memory leak in the reload endpoint: removed validators were not being offloaded from the slashing-protection in-memory cache, and every reload unnecessarily re-registered all validators, causing old-gen heap pressure. Reload now processes only the delta of added/removed keys. PR [#1167][PR_1167].
- Fix jdbi parsed-SQL cache growth in `ValidatorsDao` by replacing inlined values and bindList expansions with parameterized array bindings. PR [#1170][PR_1170].

  - `--signer-load-batch-size` (default: 500) - Files processed per batch in parallel mode
  - `--signer-load-sequential-threshold` (default: 100) - Minimum files to trigger parallel processing
  - `--signer-load-parallel` (default: true) - Enable/disable parallel processing
- New `/reload` endpoint configuration:
  - `--reload-timeout` (default: 30 min) - Maximum time for entire reload operation
- Improved reload concurrency control prevents multiple simultaneous reloads
- Include Log4J JSON Template Layout library that provides predefined event templates such as ECS and GCP layouts in log4j configuration file. PR [#1140][PR_1140].

## 23.6.0

As part of our ongoing commitment to deliver the best remote signing solutions, we are announcing a change in our product offerings.

We have decided to deprecate our [EthSigner](https://github.com/Consensys/EthSigner) product to focus our efforts on enhancing Web3Signer, our newly comprehensive remote signing solution. This is rooted in our strategy to streamline our offerings and focus on a single, robust product that will provide functionality for both transaction and Ethereum validator signing. We hope this makes it applicable to all your use-cases like public Ethereum signing, staking infrastructure offerings, and in private network contexts.

Rest assured, we are not dropping existing EthSigner functionality. We are updating Web3Signer to incorporate the functionalities of EthSigner alongside everything else in Web3Signer. We will ensure a smooth transition by maintaining EthSigner with necessary patches for an additional six months. We hope this provides ample time for any necessary migration to Web3Signer.

**We have begun adding EthSigner functionality to Web3Signer. This is a work in progress and not complete.**

## 22.11.0
### Breaking Changes
- Slashing protection imports will now only fail for an individual validator instead for all validators allowing partial
import if there is valid and invalid data.

### Features Added
- Introduced cli option to specify Hikari configuration for pruning database connection [#661](https://github.com/Consensys-Incorporated/web3signer/issues/661)
- Better database pruning default values: Pruning enabled by default with
`slashing-protection-pruning-epochs-to-keep = 250`, `slashing-protection-pruning-at-boot-enabled = false` and
`slashing-protection-pruning-interval = 12`.
- Improved performance for slashing protection import
- Introduced experimental cli option `--Xslashing-protection-db-connection-pool-enabled` to disable internal database
connection pool (Hikari) to allow using external database connection pool such as pgBouncer.
`--slashing-protection-db-pool-configuration-file` and `--slashing-protection-pruning-db-pool-configuration-file` can be
reused to specify PG Datasource properties. [#662](https://github.com/Consensys-Incorporated/web3signer/issues/662)
